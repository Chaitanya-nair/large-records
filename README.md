# Scalable records in Haskell

This repository contains all of the work on scalable records in Haskell:

- [large-records](large-records/) provides scalable _named_ records (records that are declared before they are used, just like standard Haskell records).
- [large-anon](large-anon/) provides scalable _anonymous_ records.
- [large-generics](large-generics/) is the generics library that supports both
  `large-records` and `large-anon`.
- [beam-large-records](beam-large-records/) provides integration for
  `large-records` with [beam](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/beam-core).
- [typelet](typelet/) provides experimental support for type-level sharing.
- [large-records-benchmarks](large-records-benchmarks) contains a large number
  of benchmarks measuring the (compile time) performance of the `large-records`
  library.

For a detailed overview on compile time performance of `large-records`, see
the [benchmarks report](large-records-benchmarks/report/).

The problems addressed by these libraries are discussed in a series of
blog posts:

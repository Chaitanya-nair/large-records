# Some identifiers are just created at the end of the optimisation pipeline: the
# input to the simplifier is not the output of the desugarer (see `Note
# [Injecting implicit bindings]`, `getImplicitBinds`).
#
# In fact, it seems these bindings are not visible in any of the `pass-xxxx`
# files generated by the `GhcDump` plugin, so these measurements were manually
# extracted from `dump-simpl` files.
